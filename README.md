# Undertale in Python

This is the repository for Undertale in Python. This is a passion project I've had from a young age which has now turned into me looking back at my stupid mistakes I made when I was 10 and making them not as bad.

## How to Play

### Dependencies

- Python (idk which version but I always code on the newest release which can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

### How to download

You have two options when it comes to downloading. You can either get the cutting-edge build (whatever the newest code is) or a main release. (usually released after big updates or game breaking bugs are smashed) I would recommend the newest release because that has been tested for bugs and (hopefully) doesn't have any.

- Cutting-edge build: Click the large green button called download on the main project page and then download zip. Unzip the downloaded file and run either of the .py files included.

- Release: Click releases on the main project page and then choose which version you want to download. (the newest is recommended) When here, click on the .py file for which game you want to download and then open it.

## Thank You

Please try to enjoy this absolute mess of code and if you would be kind enough and know how, please could you help me fix some bugs and make this presentable. Have a good day.
