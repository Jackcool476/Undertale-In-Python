# Undertale in Python

This is the repository for Undertale in Python. This is a passion project I've had from a young age which has turned now into me looking back at my stupid mistakes I made when I was 10 and making them not as bad. I will be updating this sometimes since I must prepare for Year 9 computing,

## How to Play

Dependencies:

You will need Python installed to open the game. (idk which version in particular but I code on the newest release which can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

How to download:

You have two options when it comes to downloading. You can either get the cutting-edge build (whatever the newest code is) or a main release. (usually released after big updates or game breaking bugs are smashed)

* Cutting-edge build: Click the large green button called download on the main project page and then download zip. Unzip this and run either of the .py files included.

* Release: Click releases on the main project page and then choose which version you want to download. (the newest is recommended) When here, click on the .py file for which game you wan to download and then run.

### Promotion

The Gamejolt page is [here](https://gamejolt.com/games/undertalepython476/386188) but I will not be updating it regularly as it is a pain to do and I will work on trying to move over to be fully a GitHub project. (Although I'm not sure how marketing would work for that.)
My Youtube channel is [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMF5plyvE3mCZA8ke_mqWcw) but I don't really upload anymore and my other videos are very cringey.

### Thank You

Please try to enjoy this absolute mess of code and if you would be kind enough and know how, please could you help me fix some bugs and make this presentable. Have a good day.
