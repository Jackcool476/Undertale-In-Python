# Undertale in Python

This is the repository for Undertale in Python. This is a passion project I've had from a young age; I'm somewhat proud of it. Now, it's just turned into me looking back at the stupid mistakes I made when I was 10 and trying to fix them.

## How to Play

### Dependencies

- Python (IDK which version, but I always code on the newest release which is found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

### How to download

You have two options when it comes to downloading. You can either get the cutting-edge build (whatever the newest code is) or the main release. (usually released after new features or game-breaking bugs are smashed) I'd recommend the most recent release because that has been tested for bugs and (hopefully) doesn't have any.

- Cutting-edge build: Click the large green button called download on the main project page and then download zip. Unzip the downloaded file and run either of the .py files included.

- Release: Click releases on the main project page and choose which version you want to download. (the newest is recommended) Here, click on the .py file for which game you want to download and then open it.

## Thank You

Please try to enjoy this absolute mess of code; if you would be kind enough and know-how, help me fix some bugs and make this presentable.
