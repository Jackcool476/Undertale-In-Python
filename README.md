# Undertale In Python

This is the repository for Undertale In Python. This is a passion project I've had from a young age which has turned now into me looking back at my stupid mistakes I made when I was 10 and making them not as bad. I will be updating this since I must prepare for Year 9 computing and prepare with a child's resume that says, "Hey, I'm not all dumb. Let me in."

### Promotion

The Gamejolt page is [here](https://gamejolt.com/games/undertalepython476/386188) but I will not be updating it regularly as it is a pain and I will work on trying to move over to be fully a GitHub project. (I'm not sure how marketing would work for that tho and I poor so no website.)
My Youtube channel is [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMF5plyvE3mCZA8ke_mqWcw) but I don't really upload anymore and it is very large cringe.

### How to Download

Download by clicking the big green Code button then download zip and, while you may have unnecessary files, you have the games. (I would use the releases tab but I make so many small changes after a long coding session there would not be much point.) I'll upload a release when game not bad lol.

## Thank You

Please try to enjoy this absolute mess of code and if you would be kind enough and have the know-how, please help me fix some bugs and make this presentable. Have a good time of day.
