# Undertale-In-Python

This is the repository for Undertale.py. As I have finished working on this, I would like to give it out to the public to mess around with.
I will be coming back here every once in a while to merge pull requests and things like that. (I don't really know what else because GitHub is complicated as hell for a teenager. Or maybe it's just me idk.) (Actually I'm kind of coding here when I feel like it in prep for my hopeful Year 9 course in computing)
The Gamejolt page is here: https://gamejolt.com/games/undertalepython476/386188 but you should probably just download it here because I won't be updating that nearly as often. (if at all)
