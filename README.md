# Undertale-In-Python

This is the repository for Undertale In Python. This is a passion project I've had from a young age which has turned now into me looking back at my stupid mistakes I made when I was ten and making them not as bad. I will be updating this since I must prepare for Year 9 computing and have an almost resume of, "Hey, I'm not all dumb. Let me in."

### Promotion

The Gamejolt page is [here](https://gamejolt.com/games/undertalepython476/386188) but I will not be updating it regularly and will work on trying to move over to be fully a GitHub project.

### How to download

Download by clicking the big green Code button then download zip and, while you may have unnecessary files, you have the games. (I would use the releases tab but I make so many small changes after a big coding session there would be no point.)

### Thank you

Please enjoy this absolute mess of code and if you would be kind enough and have the know-how, please help me fix some bugs and make this presentable. Have a good time of day.
