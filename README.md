# Undertale-In-Python

This is the repository for Undertale.py. As I have finished working on this, I would like to give it out to the public to mess around with.
I will be coming back here every once in a while to merge pull requests and things like that. (I don't really know what else because GitHub is complicated as hell for a teenager. Or maybe it's just me idk.)
